# Coref-Resolved-SQuAD

## Under Development!
This is an on going project of mine which is to resolve the coreference resolution problems existing in the SQuAD dataset and make a "good" dataset for question generatation task out of it.

The projects is currently in its starting phases and not much to write about right now but I will update this README file as the project makes progress.

## Progress
The coreferences are resolved to some point which can be found in the text files.

I have not tested how it works yet in the question generation task but I will update this file as soon as I have the scores!

I will upload the script used to resolve the coreferences after I made sure of its worth!
